  # Keyboard shortcuts: these use emacs-style strings, control keys ('A' for alt, 'C' for control, 'S' for shift) and
  # then a value key, all separated by hyphens. For example, "y" maps to unmodified 'y', "S-y" to capital 'Y', and
  # "C-A-y" to control + alt + 'y'. Keys other than letters/numbers can be accessed by name, e.g. "S-tab".
  # See legacy.lwjgl.org/javadoc/org/lwjgl/input/Keyboard.html for a full list of keys/names.
